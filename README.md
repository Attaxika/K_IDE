Description: 
K_IDE.py is a lightweight IDE designed for Python 2.7 for UNIX-based operating systems, it utilizes the GI libraries to display the data
K_IDE supports loading files, it shows a working directory in the sidebar, it supports finding, saving, auto-saving, and obviously running your
scripts/programs within the IDE
No attribution is necessary for programs made with K_IDE, but re-distributing/repackaging without any functional changes is explicitly disallowed.
If for whatever reason you want to make a change to K_IDE, go ahead and fork it
